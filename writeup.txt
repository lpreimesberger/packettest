Back-end Developer Project
For this project you will use the attached schema and dataset in dev-project.sql to create a REST API with two API endpoints:
GET /connections
This should return a list of connections with associated customer, location, and attribute data. It should support the following filters:

location name
location city
customer name
connection speed
connection status
POST /connection
This endpoint will be used to create a new connection.

Project Notes
The requirements are purposely left ambiguous as there is no "correct" way to implement the API enpoints. We are more interested to see what you come up with and the reasoning behind the design choices you make
The scope of the project is small, but we are looking for robust, production-quality code that could be used as the starting point for a full REST API
We prefer to see the project done using Python, but the specific REST framework you choose is up to you
Aim to limit the use of other requirements/dependencies as much as is reasonable
We use Postgres, so please make sure any queries necessary will run correctly against a Postgres test database
To make testing easier, the database name should be dev_project and the user/password for the database should should be dbuser/password
